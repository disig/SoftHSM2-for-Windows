NAME
       softhsm2.conf - SoftHSM configuration file

SYNOPSIS
       softhsm2.conf

DESCRIPTION
       This  is  the  configuration file for SoftHSM. It can be found on a de‐
       fault location, but can also be	relocated  by  using  the  environment
       variable.  Any  configuration must be done according to the file format
       found in this document.

FILE FORMAT
       Each configuration option is a pair of name and value  separated  by  a
       equality  sign.	The  configuration  option must be located on a single
       line.

	      <name> = <value>

       It is also possible to add comments in the file by using the hash sign.
       Anything after the hash sign will be ignored.

	      # A comment

       Any empty lines or lines that does not have the correct format will be ignored.

DIRECTORIES.TOKENDIR
       The location where SoftHSM can store the tokens.

	      directories.tokendir = C:\SoftHSM2\var\softhsm2\tokens\

OBJECTSTORE.BACKEND
       The  backend to use by SoftHSM to store token objects. Either "file" or
       "db" is supported.  In order to use the "db" backend, the SoftHSM build
       needs to be configured with "configure --with-objectstore-backend-db"

	      objectstore.backend = file

LOG.LEVEL
       The log level which can be set to ERROR, WARNING, INFO or DEBUG.

	      log.level = INFO

SLOTS.REMOVABLE
       If  set	to  true  CKF_REMOVABLE_DEVICE is set in the flags returned by
       C_GetSlotInfo. Default is false.

	      slots.removable = true

TOKEN.MECHANISMS
       Allows to enable and disable any of the PKCS#11 mechanisms reported  in
       the  C_GetMechanismList().  The option accepts string argument contain‐
       ing the comma separated list of all algorithms that should  be  enabled
       (do  not forget about the keygen mechanisms).  The list can be prefixed
       with minus sign "-" to list only the  disabled  mechanisms.   Addition‐
       ally,  special  keyword	ALL can be used to enable all the known mecha‐
       nisms (default). Unknown  mechanisms  are  ignored.   This  option  has
       higher  priority  than  the CKA_ALLOWED_MECHANISMS attribute on the key
       objects.

	      slots.mechanisms = ALL

LIBRARY.RESET_ON_FORK
       If set to true, the library will reset the state on fork.   Default  is
       false.

	      library.reset_on_fork = true

ENVIRONMENT
       SOFTHSM2_CONF
	      When  defined,  the value will be used as path to the configura‐
	      tion file.

FILES
       %HOMEDRIVE%%HOMEPATH%\softhsm2.conf
	      default user-specific  location  of  the	SoftHSM  configuration
	      file;  if  it exists it will override the system wide configura‐
	      tion

       .\softhsm2.conf
	      default system-wide location of the SoftHSM configuration file
